## About DdD  
DdD (Diameter distribution by deconvolution) is a practical tool for calculating the particle size distributions of semiconductor nanoparticles (SNPs). Based on deconvolution of the absorbance spectrum of SNPs with a database of the absorbance spectra of SNPs with different sizes, the PSDs are determined. The PSDs obtained from this method do not show any statistical difference from the one derived from TEM images. DdD could be used with different materials (eg. CdS and CdSe) in different media (eg. in solution, polymer films, and bacteria).
