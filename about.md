## About DdD  
Semiconductor nanoparticles' (**SNPs**) size strongly determines their properties, thus characterizing it is crucial for applications. With this app, we present a non-destructive, cheap and in situ  procedure to calculate particle size distributions (**PSDs**) of SNPs in different media based on **deconvolution** of the absorbance spectrum with a database of the absorbance spectra of SNPs with different sizes. The method was validated against the SNP sizes obtained from transmission microscopy images, showing excellent agreement between both distributions.
